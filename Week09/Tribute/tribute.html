        <h3>The life of Jerry Bear</h3>
        <blockquote>
          
          <p class = "Lead"><strong>Jerry Wayne Bear</strong> was a mann of few words. He spent 
          much of his life as a truck driver but he was so much more than that. He was a husband,
        father, stepfather, grandfather, stepgrandfather, great grandfather, and great step grandfather.He was 
      a fair man who never differentiated between his step children and biological children. He treated 
    his step children and step grandchildren the same as if they were his own and in many ways 
  they were. </p>
