          <p class = "Lead"><strong>Jerry Wayne Bear</strong> was a man of few words.
             He spent much of his life as an over the road truck driver but he was
              so much more than that. He was a husband, father, grandfather,
               and great grandfather. He was a fair man who never differentiated
                between his step children and biological children. He treated his 
                step children and step grandchildren as if they were his own and 
                in many ways they were. He was married to Wealthy A. Hutchison on 
                October 10, 1975. </p>

      <div class="boxed">
         <p class = "Lead">Jerry was someone to look up to. He was hard working man 
            and who there for his family. He worked for and retired from Arch 
            Chemicals of Brandenburg, Kentucky. He spent weeks at a time on the 
          road but when he would return from his travels, he spent that time with his
           family. To grow up and be half the man that he was, would be an 
           accomplishment.

             help anyone in need. He continued to go hunting up to his passing in 2019.</p></font>
